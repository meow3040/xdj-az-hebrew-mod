 * @file inline_hooks.c
 * @brief AArch64 inline-hook and vtable-patch primitives used by every azmod hook
 *
 * azm_install_hook replaces the first instruction of an EP147 function with a B to a
 * 16-byte jump in a nearby executable island (one atomic store, so a thread already in
 * the function sees the old or the new code, never half of each), and builds a trampoline
 * holding the relocated instruction followed by a jump back. Without an island in B range
 * it falls back to overwriting four instructions with an absolute jump (LDR X17 / BR X17).
 * The fallback is allowed only while azmod's constructor runs (EP147's main has not started,
 * so no EP147 code can be executing); after azm_hooks_go_late() a hook without an island in
 * reach is refused (AZM_REFUSED_LATE) instead of being written non-atomically under a running
 * EP147. Every call is recorded with the path it took and azm_hooks_dump() writes the table.
 * The trampoline is returned through *orig. A function whose first four instructions
 * contain a PC-relative branch, literal load or adr is declined (returns -1) because it
 * cannot be relocated safely; a null or misaligned address is also declined. An adrp is
 * re-encoded when its target still reaches from the trampoline, otherwise its absolute
 * result is materialized with movz/movk.
 *
 * azm_patch_vtable swaps one vtable slot and returns the
 * original, which avoids prologue relocation entirely but only intercepts virtual calls
 * through that vtable. Callers must check the return value and treat a decline as "hook
 * not installed".
 *
 * Entry points: azm_install_hook, azm_patch_vtable, azm_hooks_go_late, azm_hooks_dump.
