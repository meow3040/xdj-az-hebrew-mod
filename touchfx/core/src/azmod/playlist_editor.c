 * @brief Playlist Editing: reorder, create, rename and delete playlists and folders in Browse
 *
 * Reordering is a view plus one native write. Holding the browse knob arms a grab (EP147's
 * own long press, seen through knobev_hook); turning the knob moves the held row by
 * permuting which data row EP147's row painters are asked to draw, and a click commits.
 * The commit runs EP147's music_library::InformationUpdater::movePlaylistTrack on the
 * library thread at a MusicLibraryServer onMessage boundary (mlserver_onmsg_hook), after
 * the row identity captured from the browse hierarchy has been re-proven and the
 * connection is in autocommit. BACK cancels. The hooks live on the message thread.
 *
 * Creating, renaming and deleting playlists and folders use EP147's SoftwareKeyboardWidget,
 * lent from SearchView to BrowseView and fed through intercepted keyboard listener slots
 * (nm_* and nl_*), then write the library rows through EP147's own sqlite connection
 * (nl_create, nl_rename, fd_delete). The label paint hook (hlabel_paint_hook) draws the
 * landing flash, selection brackets, cut ghost and stems mark on playlist and track labels;
 * either feature installs it via install_hlabel_paint_slot. The reorder and naming hooks are
 * installed by install_reorder and follow the Mod Menu's Playlist Editing toggle live; off,
 * the deck is stock. The selection hooks (mediaobj_find_hook, lsfind_hook) are shared with
 * MAKE STEMS.
 *
 * Entry points: azmod_naming_playlist, azmod_naming_folder, azmod_naming_rename,
 * azmod_naming_create, azmod_naming_cancel, azmod_naming_dirty, install_reorder,
 * install_selection_hooks, pledit_at_start.

 *                           caller, request handler 0x12b2058, has no callers).
 *   Where it runs           EP147's library thread, at a message boundary:
 *                           MusicLibraryServer::onMessage (vtable slot +0x50) runs us

 *                           that re-reads the playlist table: harmless and native.
 *   The refresh             native: movePlaylistTrack invalidates the track-list cache and
 *                           EP147 re-queries and redraws, its selection following the
 *                           moved track.
 *
 * Hazard: EP147's move keys the moved row on `sequenceNo = from` alone. A wrong `from`
 * moves the wrong track, and a duplicated sequenceNo moves two. So right before the write,
 * on the same connection, the DB must show the playlist is 1..N contiguous with no
 * duplicates and the row at `from` is the grabbed track. Otherwise nothing is written and
